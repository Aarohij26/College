A console-based program called the Library Management System enables administrators and patrons to oversee a library's collection of books.
Using a password-protected portal, administrators may add, search, issue, and return books while controlling their availability. Viewing all books, looking up titles, and returning borrowed materials are all available to users. To guarantee that data is retained between sessions, the system stores book data to a CSV file. 
CSV files are used to store data so that it may be easily retrieved and altered.
It offers a user-friendly interface with a straightforward text-based menu, making it a great project for learning Python object-oriented programming and file management.A console-based program called the "Library Management System" enables administrators and patrons to oversee a library's collection of books.
